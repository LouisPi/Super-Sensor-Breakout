# Super-Sensor-Breakout

This is the page for the schematic, PCB files and wiki for the Super Sensor Breakout.

Unfortunately, as I am forced to work on easyeda.com as my computers (Pis and a Chromebook) do not support Kicad, Eagle etc. so popular editable files can not be provided. Instead easyeda project links are available and it is pretty easy to get the hang of. Also, Altium files are provided as easyeda also supports exporting them.

If you have purchased this product, I highly recommend you read the wiki before using the product to make sure you have it set up correctly.
