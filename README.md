# Super-Sensor-Breakout

This is the page for the schematic, PCB files and wiki for the Super Sensor Breakout.

Unfortunately, as I am forced to work on [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com) as my computers (Pis and a Chromebook) do not support Kicad, Eagle etc. so popular editable files can not be provided. Instead, [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com) project links are available and it is pretty easy to get the hang of. Also, Altium files are provided as [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com) also supports exporting them.

If you have purchased this product, I highly recommend you read the wiki before using the product to make sure you have it set up correctly.
